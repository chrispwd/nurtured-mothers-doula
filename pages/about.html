         <img alt="headshot" src="" class="block w-64 h-64 border"/>
         <p>Elora is a certified birth and postpartum doula in Nampa, Idaho. She specialized in holistic care for mothers during this transformative period.</p>
         <quote>Through deep connection with my clients, I hope to help them achieve the birth and/or postpartum they desire. I believe that although much of mothering is a learned skill, you hold within you the innate knowledge, power, and intuition to birth and care for your baby.</quote>
         <img alt="headshot2" src="" class="block w-64 h-64 border"/>
         <p>When I'm not working with clients, you can find me with my own two babies, usually at home.</p>
